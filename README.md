# Calculator
This is a simple calculator for adding, subtracting, multiplying or dividing integer or decimal values.

It has been coded using HTML, CSS and JavaScript languages as an exercise for completing the "Project: Calculator" lesson at the end of the Foundations Course, inside The Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/) and by following the specified guidelines in the lesson.

Finding the way for the math to work properly in JavaScript turned out to be a little challenging, but I ended up using the decimals.js library to help me achieve it and I believe it has been resolved.

For the moment, the calculator is funcional, but in the future I would like to maybe add the following:

- Add buttons: <kbd>-/+</kbd>, <kbd>%</kbd>, <kbd>M+</kbd> and <kbd>MR</kbd>
- Improve display functionality: show the selected operator and the entered operation on the display as it is typed on the keypad
- Improve overall visual design
- Write tests for the code
- Refactor the code to be cleaner and simpler

## Try the Calculator
